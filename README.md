Nexus - AI Prompt-based App

Nexus is an Android application built using Jetpack Compose that leverages dependency injection, supports both dark and light themes, incorporates a splash screen, handles API requests, and checks for network availability. It functions similarly to an AI model like ChatGPT, where users input prompts and receive responses generated by an API.

Features
Jetpack Compose UI: Nexus utilizes Jetpack Compose for building its user interface, providing a modern and efficient way to create UI components.

Dependency Injection: The application uses dependency injection to manage the creation and lifecycle of objects, promoting modularization and testability.

Dark/Light Theme Support: Nexus offers support for both dark and light themes, allowing users to choose their preferred visual experience by calling the icon at top right of app.

Splash Screen: A splash screen is implemented to provide users with a seamless and visually appealing app launch experience.

API Integration: The app integrates with an Gemini API to generate responses based on user prompts, simulating a conversational AI experience.

Network Availability: Nexus checks for network availability to ensure that users can interact with the app only when a stable internet connection is present.
